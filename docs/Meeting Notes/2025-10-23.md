# 2025-10-16

- Progress looking into ros:
  - Will: got a python node communicating with a cpp node
- Compilation for robocup:
  - Apoorva: was able to compile without gpu
    - Vision needs GPU to run

- TODO:
  - Look more into the robocup repo with knowledge of how ros works
    - get an idea of what data brain expects from sim and vision
    - what output does sim expect from brain
  - might reset GPU lab machine to Ubuntu 22
  - Start working on interfacing between sim and agent
    - want to keep TCP
    - TCP -> ros bridge -> ros agent
  - Continue figuring out how to get policies from Isaac into brain running on mujoco
  - Apoorva can help people get robocup compiled on non-GPU devices
    - start looking into how we can get robocup repo running without vision (no-GPU)
  -
