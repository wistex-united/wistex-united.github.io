- Progress looking into ros:
  - Will: game_controller, joystick, brain are hooked up to the Mujoco sim
    - Also got rerun setup for logging and localization visualization
  - Launching game contrller for ros_client also works now

- TODO:
  - Try to get existing robocup walk policy working in booster-system
  - Work on stabilizing localization
  - Work on new behavior tree or getting the existing one in robocup to work in booster-system
