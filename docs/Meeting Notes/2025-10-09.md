# 2025-10-09

- Ensure that everyone can install and run the [`robocup-mujoco`](https://github.com/wistex-united/robocup-mujoco) repo.
- Get the [`robocup`](https://github.com/wistex-united/robocup) repo running on the lab machine; since it requires Ubuntu 22, we will need to use Docker or potentially switch the system to Ubuntu 22 (currently using Ubuntu 24).
- Figure out how to turn `robocup-mujoco` into something with SimRobot compabilities (i.e., realistic perception/localization, full game simulation, able to train with RL, easily deployable).
- Reach out to 3D sim league developers to better understand how to use `robocup-mujoco` and see if they have tried the things mentioned above.
- Evaluate the sim-to-real/sim-to-sim gap of`robocup-mujoco` (run Booster's walk policy?).
- Look into getting [`booster_gym`](https://github.com/BoosterRobotics/booster_gym) running as a way to get policies trained in Isaac Gym running in mujoco
