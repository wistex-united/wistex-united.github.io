# 2025-10-16

- Came up with a plan for building on [`robocup-mujoco`](https://github.com/wistex-united/robocup-mujoco):
  - `robocup-mujoco` consists of a single simulation server that communicates with any number of agents & monitors over network. 
  - Idea is to develop a ROS2-based agent that directly runs Booster's C++ ROS2 nodes; can replace behavior-related nodes (brain) with our own Python nodes to make the agent RL trainable.
  - Can also develop a Python-only agent for training policies that don't require realisitc observations (like AbstractSim).
- **Tasks**
  - Get `robocup-mujoco` working on Mac.
  - Get [`robocup`](https://github.com/wistex-united/robocup) working on lab machine.
  - Learn ROS2 basics.
  - Get Booster's walk policy working on `robocup-mujoco` to verify simulation integrity.
